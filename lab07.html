    <h2>CSS Layout 11Float</h2>
    <p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer. On smaller screens, the columns will
        stack on top of each other.</p>
    <p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML
        Responsive.)</p>

            <h1>London</h1>

                metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going
                back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
